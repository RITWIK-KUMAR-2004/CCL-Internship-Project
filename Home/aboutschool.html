            <h3>School in Present Form</h3>

            <h4>The School, in its present form, is a joint venture of the DAV College Managing Committee and the Coal India Limited (CIL). The erstwhile Shishu Vihar was handed over to the committee in 1990, and getting the matchless managing capability of the committee and the timely cooperation of the CIL, the Vihar has bloomed into a DAV school par excellence, making a miraculous leap in such a short period. To sum up, the mission of DAV Public School Gandhi Nagar(CCL) is “to open doors and open minds” and prepare the ground for the future of the nation.</h4>
            <span> At present, it is a +2 school, affiliated to the CBSE. The streams of Science and Commerce are available here for </span><span>Classes XI and XII.</span>

            <h3>Local</h3>

            <h4>The School is situated in the lap of the neat and clean environs of the Gandhi Nagar Colony, which is some 5 KM away from the town, thus far away from the hustle and bustle and fatal noises of the Capital. At the same time, it is not an isolated place, as it is in the heart of the peaceful colony. Such a locale is a rarity!</h4>
